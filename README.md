# Senior Design Project(ECE445) - Custom Illini Solar Car MPPT

## TLDR:
This project contains both the HW and FW for a boost converter MPPT made for the 3rd generation vehicle of Illini Solar Car. It utilizes a simple perturb and observe algorithm (P&O).

## More Info: 
The goal of this project was to develop custom and low cost solar Maximum Power Point Trackers (MPPTs). These MPPTs use a boost converter to optimize power output from the solar array to charge the battery efficiently. With the array divided into three sections for reliability, each MPPT gives redundancy to the system. Customization gives simple integration with the vehicle's electrical systems, allowing for plug-and-play functionality. This cost-effective solution takes away the need for expensive off-the-shelf components and provides access to schematics for easy maintenance and upgrades.
